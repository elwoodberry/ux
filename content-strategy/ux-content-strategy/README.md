**Content Strategy**  
Planning for the creation, delivery, and governance of useful, usable content.

**How Do You Deal With Content?**  
UX is not just about the form.  

Its not about the devices or the content. Its about the people (the users) that create all this stuff.

**What Does One Of Those Projects Look Like?** (04:42)
* Thinking through the print to web strategy (in this case, a hospital).
* Publishing content on ongoing basis.
* What has to change in order for their people to collaborate together.

**Content Management** is not a technology decision. It is a people decision. It's less about the specifics of the database and more about how people have to work together.

**The Audience**  
1. Freelancers
2. Small and medium agencies
3. Transitioning agencies

**Demystify UX**  
What would you tell a freelance that is growing who has yet to hit some of those challenges.

"... I think one of the benefit of UX as a mindset, as a point of view, is that it puts the effort into trying to understand who is the person coming to this website.."

**It's About The User Not What The Client Wants**  
1. ".. People who worked in traditional medias (print, branding, etc.)... Alot of the time the decisions where based on the business owner."  
1. ".. and they are not grounded in how do you make decisions based on the users (what they want to see and do)"
1. ".. The slippery thing you gotta get away from is letting clients tell you what they want.."
1. ".. It's about making sure that the person that comes there can find and do what they wanted."


**Print Layout vs Web Design Layout**  
* Content and its fluidity
* Content lives in multiple places at the same time

1. "..With brick and mortar design..  you design it and then you're done..."
1. "... With the web you are not so much making a magazine.. you're making a tool for on-going care, feeding and maintenance."
    1. What is it going to be?
    1. How will it evolve over time?

**THE WEB: Living and Breathing Thing**  
1. ".. I think for alot of designers that are accustom to working in things where there is a deadline... its hard to think that you have to think in systems now."
1. ".. I'm going to layout this particular page and the content on it is going to be completely perfect and everything is going to be aligned to the pixel...you come back to see they have ruined your layout with a bunch of crap you were not anticipating."
1. "..When you are really working on the web you realize that it was your fault. Good design on the web means accounting for flexibility."

**What is Content Modeling?**  
1. "..the problem most people run into is trying to build a website and you get to the 11th hour and realize you don't have the content.."
1. "..for a lot of design processes you don't need all the content."
1. "..What you need is a sense of the structure of the content.."
    1. "What types of content are there going to be?"
    1. "Whats the purpose of that content?"
    1. "Who is that content for?"
    1. "What are the expected sizes and shapes of that content? (big titles, small titles, etc)"
1. "..content modeling is the process where you sit down and start to work through what you expect this content to be.."
1. Facilitates client interaction
1. "..if you give the client some specs that gives them something to work towards."
1. A content style guide

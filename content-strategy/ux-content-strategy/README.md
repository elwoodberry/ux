**Content Strategy**  
Planning for the creation, delivery, and governance of useful, usable content.

**How Do You Deal With Content?**  
UX is not just about the form.  

Its not about the devices or the content. Its about the people (the users) that create all this stuff.

**What Does One Of Those Projects Look Like?** (04:42)
* Thinking through the print to web strategy (in this case, a hospital).
* Publishing content on ongoing basis.
* What has to change in order for their people to collaborate together.

**Content Management** is not a technology decision. It is a people decision. It's less about the specifics of the database and more about how people have to work together.

**The Audience**  
1. Freelancers
2. Small and medium agencies
3. Transitioning agencies

**Demystify UX**  
What would you tell a freelance that is growing who has yet to hit some of those challenges.

"... I think one of the benefit of UX as a mindset, as a point of view, is that it puts the effort into trying to understand who is the person coming to this website.."

**It's About The User Not What The Client Wants**  
1. ".. People who worked in traditional medias (print, branding, etc.)... Alot of the time the decisions where based on the business owner."  
2. ".. and they are not grounded in how do you make decisions based on the users (what they want to see and do)"
3. ".. The slippery thing you gotta get away from is letting clients tell you what they want.."
4. ".. It's about making sure that the person that comes there can find and do what they wanted."


**Print Layout vs Web Design Layout**
